1. To compile:
    go to BE/FE folder and do 'npm i'
2. How start:
  1a. BE : move to dxp-dinosaur-be folder and do 'npm start'
  1b. FE : move to dxp-dinosaur-fe folder and do 'npm start'

3. Things left to do.
   -> Tests for React pages
   -> move to yarn (?)
   -> CSS usage

4. Some notes:
  3a. FE
    -> FE uses input form validation
  3b. BE
    -> to check it's running you can start Postman
    -> using pre-commit hooks with tests
    -> Using JEST for unit tests
    -> use pre-commit hook which runs the unit tests and eslint
